**For demo purposes, selecting Tokyo, Japan allows you to explore all available tool features.** (Because of data volume constraints, only the selected datasets are stored in this GitHub repository.)


This program provides interactive visualizations and predictions for plant bloom patterns:

**Predicted bloom dates**: Based on the correlation between NDVI and cumulative GDD, bloom dates can be provided for all years from 2019 onward.

**NDVI visualization**: Users can explore yearly changes in NDVI values for a selected year and region on a 3D globe model (2019–2024).

**GDD animation**: Cumulative GDD trends can be animated on a map, allowing an intuitive understanding of plant development patterns throughout the year (2019–2024).

With this tool, users can gain insights into historical bloom patterns, environmental influences, and future predictions in a visually engaging and intuitive format.


This presentation slide provides an overview of the bloom prediction tool Global BloomWatch, including its objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.
